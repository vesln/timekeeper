This module mocks `Date` and `Date.now` in order to help you test time-dependent code.
Provides `travel` and `freeze` functionality for your Node.js tests.

## Installation

- NPM: `npm install timekeeper --save-dev`
- Bower: `bower install timekeeper`

## Synopsis

### Freeze:

```js
var tk = require('timekeeper');
var time = new Date(1330688329321);

tk.freeze(time);

// The time hasn't changed at all.

var date = new Date;
var ms = Date.now();

tk.reset(); // Reset.

```

### Travel:

```js
var tk = require('timekeeper');
var time = new Date(1893448800000); // January 1, 2030 00:00:00

tk.travel(time); // Travel to that date.

setTimeout(function() {

	// `time` + ~500 ms.

	var date = new Date;
	var ms = Date.now();

	tk.reset(); // Reset.

}, 500);
```

Note: If traveling when time is frozen, the time will be frozen to the new traveled time.

### Reflection:

```js
var tk = require('timekeeper');
var time = new Date(1893448800000); // January 1, 2030 00:00:00

assertFalse(tk.isKeepingTime());
tk.travel(time);
assertTrue(tk.isKeepingTime());
```

## Requirements

- npm (http://npmjs.org/)
- Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)

## Tests

```
$ cd timekeeper
$ npm install
$ make test
```

## Releases
For maintainers only. `mversion` is used as a substitute for `npm version` to
simultaneously bump `package.json` and `bower.json`, create a new commit,
and a version tag at the new commit.
```
$ mversion <patch | minor | major>
$ git push --follow-tags
$ npm publish
```
