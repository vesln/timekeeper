# timekeeper

This module mocks `Date` and `Date.now` in order to help you test time-dependent code. It provides `travel` and `freeze` functionality for your Node.js tests.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev timekeeper
```

## Synopsis

### Freeze:

```js
var tk = require('timekeeper');
var time = new Date(1330688329321);

tk.freeze(time);

// The time hasn't changed at all.

var date = new Date;
var ms = Date.now();

tk.reset(); // Reset.

```

### Travel:

```js
var tk = require('timekeeper');
var time = new Date(1893448800000); // January 1, 2030 00:00:00

tk.travel(time); // Travel to that date.

setTimeout(function() {
  // `time` + ~500 ms.

  var date = new Date;
  var ms = Date.now();

  tk.reset(); // Reset.
}, 500);
```

Note: If traveling when time is frozen, the time will be frozen to the new traveled time.

### Reflection:

```js
var tk = require('timekeeper');
var time = new Date(1893448800000); // January 1, 2030 00:00:00

assertFalse(tk.isKeepingTime());
tk.travel(time);
assertTrue(tk.isKeepingTime());
```
